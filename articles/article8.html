    <h4>
        By Evelyn Archibald, Kalysta Frost, Mytrisha Sarmiento
    </h4>
    <p>
        Cristina Osmeña, Congressional candidate for the 14th district in California, is a strong Republican - but she’s not your typical GOP
        candidate. She’s a proud Filipina immigrant and defines herself as a centrist, neither extremely conservative or liberal.  
    </p>
    <p>
        “I blur the lines,” Ms. Osmeña said, differentiating herself from a majority of the caucasian male Republicans in congress, 
        “It’s time for a minority to represent this district,”. However, she does show some similar behavior to some of the top Republicans 
        when describing congressional opponent, Jackie Speier, as “Tired Jackie”.   
    </p>
    <p>
        Ms. Osmeña visited Summit Shasta High School on Aug. 23, at the request of the 2018-19 journalism class, and gave a mock press conference
        style interview. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Ms. Osmeña shares many values and ideas of the Republican party, but she also has some similarities with the Democratic party. While
        she believes in a smaller government, she does not want to disrupt the Democratic process we practice. While she is against open borders,
        she believes everyone should have to chance to be in this country legally. 
    </p>
    <p>
        “There’s no problem with Social Security as it is now,” Ms. Osmeña said. “The problem is that it’s going to be more and more 
        lopsided.” Fiscal responsibility is a very important issue to Ms. Osmeña and the Republican party as a whole. She describes herself 
        as a “social liberal, fiscal conservative” and dreams of a government that is “more mindful of their fiscal responsibility.”

    </p>
    <p>
        Ms. Osmeña is a very different person than some of the loudest Republican voices today. For starters, as a racial minority, an immigrant
        and a woman, she already challenges the conservative views of certain members of the current presidential administration. Regarding ideas
        and stances, she also differs from most of her political peers.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Congressional candidate is not afraid to call out the faults of the Republican party and to acknowledge it has a bad rap. She also
        regards the Democrats as separate from her, despite what people might assume from her background. Democrats and Republicans are often
        thought of as synonyms for liberal and conservative, but Ms. Osmeña challenges that. 
    </p>
    <p>
        One student asked the candidate why she should earn the minority vote, to which Ms. Osmeña responded, “When you have a minority in
        Congress, it’s no longer a large leap.” 
    </p>
    <p>
        Being a minority in a majority could be a step in advancing the typical Republican views/opinions, as well as supporting the minority
        population. “It’s more than just symbolic,” she said, “And I feel like my values would not be so different.”
